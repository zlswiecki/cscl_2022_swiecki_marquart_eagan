The change in battery from NiCd to LiPo allowed for a much higher payload for about 60 dollars less and gave us maybe 24 minutes of extra use before needing a recharge.  It also caused us to lose agility and safety but only so much that it was no longer ideal.  It still met all minimum standards of the consultants.  This leads me to think that our best route is to ideally forget about higher ROMs, even 4 was putting unnecessary constraints on our prototypes.
